          <p> Major League Soccer played its inaugural season in 1996 with 10 teams, barely any funding, and some of the absolute worst jerseys you’ve ever seen (seriously, if you need to kill a couple minutes on the internet, look up old goalie shirts). Now, MLS is up to 28 teams in 2 countries, with 22 of those team competing in stadiums built specifically for the sport of soccer. Yet despite continued growth, the league has struggled to find a footing in an overcrowded American sports market. When fans and journalists alike refer to American pro sports, the conversation revolves around “The Big Four;” football (National Football League), baseball (National Baseball League), basketball (NBA), and hockey (National Hockey League). Combining the young age of the league with the small share of the American sports market it was given means that MLS is still struggling to break into the mainstream. Its average player salary was $410,000. Compare that to the lowest of the big four, the NHL, whose average player salary was over 6.5 times that figure, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/675120/average-sports-salaries-by-league/">Statista.com</a>.</p> 

          <p>But the most promising sign for the league by far is its growth. Yes, it doesn’t have the command that fans may think it should in the American sports psyche, but it has maintained a steady and constant growth, something that can’t be said for other leagues. The league is not immune from an off-season or two, and was especially hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, but overall has seen a drastic uptick in attendance. That uptick was especially helped when the league secured its first broadcasting rights deal with ESPN at the beginning in the 2015 season. The league went from relying on local TV networks to broadcast games to nation-wide streaming available on all platforms for fans of any team regardless of location. With more places to watch means more viewers, too. 825,000 people watched the 2019 MLS Cup Final on TV, which isn’t a lot, but the importance of stats for MLS isn’t the size, but rather the change. The 2020 MLS cup final broke over a million viewers, a 38% increase, as per <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/18/major-league-soccer-viewership-is-up-now-it-needs-networks-to-pay-more.html">CNBC</a>. While the league may not be able to stack up just yet to the Big Four, it’s slowly but surely making its case to be the 5th big major league in the states.</p>

        <h5><strong>The snowball may not be big enough for the snowman just yet, but it's rolling along</strong></h5>
      
        <p>As the league started to grow, so did the efforts to get more fans in seats. Major League Soccer teams started as a league built for the die-hard fans of the sport, for the people yearning for elite level talent on display in the states. But as the 20th century came and went, and interest slowly started to gain traction, the league chose a different approach. Family marketing has been the main trajectory for teams of the past couple years. An MLS match is billed as a fun-for-the-whole-family outing, with ticket price affordable for a wide range of incomes. And it started to work, too. Compared to the Big Four, Major League Soccer was the only league to have double-digit growth in league-wide average attendance from 2012-2019.</p>

        <p>The NFL wasn’t included in the chart on the right because its average attendance is over 60,000, and actually decreased in that seven year period, alongwith average attendance in the MLB. In fact, the % average attendance growth from the NHL, and NBA together is barely a quarter of the strides MLS has made. Where did this growth come from? A unique gameday atmosphere that combines support of die-hard fans and curious visitors alike. Cory Cloutier is the president of The Rebellion, a supporters group for the New England Revolution. The Rebels get to Gillette Stadium early and party late, rain or shine, chanting and singing for 90 minutes and sometimes more in The Fort, a designated section for fans like Cloutier. Cloutier has been going to Revolution games since the inaugural season when he was a kid, and has been involved with The Rebellion since 2012, witnessing the growth of the league first-hand.</p>

        <p>So how has the league gotten that growth, exactly? Well, according to Cloutier, it’s a uniquely welcoming atmosphere. 
        </p> 
        <p>“The beauty of it all is that there’s something for everyone,” Cloutier said. “If you want to be rowdy and loud and chant, and want to make some new friends and get together and stand up the whole game, there’s an atmosphere for you. If you’re just trying to just enjoy a night out with friends and have a good time, the rest of the stadium is there for you. There’s opportunities for people of all ages and all personalities, and you don’t get that everywhere.”</p> 
        <p>The other big selling point for the league has been the caliber of the players. Many soccer fans in the US watch overseas leagues, including a good bit of MLS fans, too, and know the big names in the game. That’s why its such a big deal when an international icon like David Beckham says he’s going to come finish his playing career in the states. The former LA Galaxy man also now owns his own MLS franchise, Inter Miami FC. Other world-reknown stars like Frank Lampard, David Villa, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and Andrea Pirlo all finished their playing days in the MLS, helping to bolster interest for the league. While it still may be regarded as a retirement destination for some of the planet's best footballers, it still draws the attention of soccer fans on this side of the pond to see their icons in action a little closer to home, which has helped spur the growth of the league stateside.</p>
        <p>“Look at where MLS has come from in the last 10 years,” Cloutier said. “If you had told me that the league would be selling players back to Europe for $20 million, or that we’d be a top 10 ranked league in the world back then, I would’ve laughed. MLS has not only grown, but is on a very high path of growing even further.” </p>
        <p>While it may not be big enough to be put on the same pedestal as the Big Four in the eyes of many, it is an exponentially growing world appreciated by the few, and soon to be known by all as the next great American major league.</p>
